  title: Fusing bones
  description: The chief of the village just came crying for help. His younger son
    just fell down a tree and broke his leg. The ritual to heal bones is more complicated
    than you should be doing now, but we have no choice. It requires an unbroken human
    bone, some blood and some of the red weed you can find in the forest. There is
    no time to waste, if you fail the chief will eat us for breakfast.
  endDescription: "Where did you get the skull? You wouldn\u2019t have killed anyone,
    would you?"
