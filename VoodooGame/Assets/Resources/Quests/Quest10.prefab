  title: Meat Fest
  description: "The chief was torturing a prisoner this morning, I was there just
    socializing\u2026 The chief loves this stuff, and I have to pretend I do too.
    The prisoner claimed he and his group killed one of our guards and buried him
    along with some of the treasures they stole in the forest, beneath a big tree.
    It\u2019s not that I believe him, who would be that stupid to bury all that there?\r\nAnyway,
    all this has left me very hungry, torture is a very exhausting activity. Let's
    make a super feast. Can you provide four different kinds of meat? Let\u2019s call
    it progress in your shamanic training..."
  endDescription: "Really tasty, I don\u2019t know which meat sources do you have,
    but it was good."
