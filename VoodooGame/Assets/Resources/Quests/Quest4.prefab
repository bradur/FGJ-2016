  title: Useful afterlife
  description: "Many of our rituals involve using human remains. Let's see how you
    can deal with fresh human meat in your hands. I don't want you to kill anybody\u2026
    at least not yet. Fortunately the local graveyard to the south can provide a steady
    supply of body parts. The gravedigger is a friend of us and he will not bother
    you.\r\nOld Mrs. Stone died last week, so her body must still be fresh. Go to
    her tomb, dig her out and bring me some of her meat. "
  endDescription: You took so long, even if you killed somebody, the meat would be
    rotten.
