  title: Talking to spirits
  description: "You are progressing quite nicely, you may even complete your training
    and become a shaman, unlike your predecessor\u2026 damm, it was nasty what happened
    there\u2026 Let\u2019s see if you can complete the next trial. You have to talk
    with the earth spirits. The power to do so resides in some particular stones,
    humans call them jewels. Bring me one of every type you can find. I\u2019m not
    going to force to steal from the highest classy people of our society. It\u2019s
    not my job to find the ingredients required for the ritual; it\u2019s yours."

    it\u2019s not really needed for you to undergo this ritual? You can become a shaman
    nevertheless.\r\nThe jewels? Yes, I'll keep them for future rituals."
