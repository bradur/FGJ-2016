  description: "The weather prediction was not of the likings of our fellow villagers,
    and they decided not to pay. What should we have said? It\u2019s the spirits who
    spoke!\r\nSetting that aside, we need to teach the villagers a lesson. You will
    cast a lesser curse upon them. It\u2019s called \u201CPredators are lurking\u201D.
    Everybody in the village will imagine the shadow of a huge panther sneaking into
    the village. They will be scared as hell.\r\nIt requires you to bring me a panther
    alive, any plant and a piece of jade.\r\nI know, I know, how are you find a panther
    here? Use your imagination!\r\nWealthy people have their graveyard adorned with
    jade, probably there are leftovers in  the graveyard. it shouldn\u2019t be hard
    to get."
