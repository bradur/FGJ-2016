    and they decided not to pay. What should we have said? It\u2019s the spirits who
    spoke!\r\nSetting that aside, we need to teach the villagers a lesson. You will
    cast a lesser curse upon them. It\u2019s called \u201CPredators are lurking\u201D.
    Everybody in the village will imagine the shadow of a huge panther sneaking into
    the village. They will be scared as hell.\r\nIt requires you to bring me a panther
    alive, any plant and a piece of jade.\r\nI know, I know, how are you find a panther
    here? Use your imagination!\r\nWealthy people have their graveyard adorned with
    jade, probably there are leftovers in  the graveyard. it shouldn\u2019t be hard
    to get."
