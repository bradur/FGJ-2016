  title: Profitable ritual
  description: "Damn, now that you healed the chief\u2019s son, we are getting many
    requests from all over the village. People don\u2019t understand how serious this
    is! However, there was one proposition who actually looked very profitable\u2026
    I\u2019m sure the spirits will agree.\r\nMr Whine is having very intense toothache,
    so much he is willing to pay us a significant amount of gold if we can make it
    go. To fulfill that ritual we need to spill some blood over a candle, and burn
    a flower over it. I wonder what the hell the spirits were thinking, maybe even
    some ancient shaman got it wrong, but yeah, that\u2019s what you must do."
  endDescription: Mr Whine drank the blood from the ritual. He says his toothache
    is gone, but he spent several days sitting on the toilet. Man is never happy!
